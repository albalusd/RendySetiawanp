/*
 * This example demonstrates how easy it is to perform asynchronous
 * HTTP client requests using the integrated libcurl support.
 *
 * In this example we setup 2 states for an HTTP request:
 *	1) setup
 *		We initialize the HTTP request and fire it off.
 *		This will put our HTTP request to sleep and it be woken up
 *		by Kore when a response is available or something went wrong.
 *
 *	2) result
 *		After we have woken up we have access to the result.
