/*
 * This example demonstrates on how to use state machines and
 * asynchronous pgsql queries. For a synchronous query example
 * see the pgsql-sync/ example under the examples/ directory.
 *
 * While this example might seem overly complex for a simple pgsql
 * query, there is a reason behind its complexity:
 *	Asynchronous pgsql queries mean that Kore will not block while
 *	executing the queries, giving a worker time to continue handling
 *	other events such as I/O or other http requests.
 *
 * The state machine framework present in Kore makes it trivial
 * to get going into dropping from your page handler into the right
 * state that you are currently in.
 *
 * The example connects to a local pgsql database (test) using a table
 * called "coders" (which has 2 columns): name, surname.
