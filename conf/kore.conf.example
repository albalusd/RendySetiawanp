# Authentication configuration
#
# Using authentication blocks you can define a standard way for
# Kore to validate your users. In the example below we create
# a authentication block called auth_example, which requires
# a cookie (session_id) to be set.
#
# If no cookie is present or the cookie is not valid according
# to the set validator, Kore will redirect the browser to the
# URI set in authentication_uri.
#
# Page handlers can be bound to authentication by specifying
# authentication block at the end of the page directive (see below).
authentication auth_example {
	# The authentication type denotes the way the user should
	# be authenticated.
	#
	# Allow values:
	#	- cookie (checks for the cookie presence + pass to validator)
	#	- header (checks for header presence + pass to validator)
	#	- requuest (passes the http_request to the validator)
	#
	# Use cases for request could for example be IP based ACLs or
	# any other criteria that can be extracted from a http_request.
	#
	# The request type does not need an authentication_validator.
	#
	authentication_type		cookie

	# The name of whatever we are looking for.
	authentication_value		session_id

	# The validator that will be called to verify the cookie.
	# Note this is YOUR validator, Kore does not have built-in
	# session support. You must add this manually using your
	# preferred method (Storing it in postgres, redis, ...)
	authentication_validator	v_session

	# The URI Kore will redirect to if a authentication fails.
	# If this is not set, Kore will return a simple 403.
	authentication_uri		/private
}

# Domain configuration
#
# Each domain configuration starts with listing what domain
# the directives that follow are to be applied upon.
#
# Additionally you can specify the following in a domain configuration:
#
#	accesslog
#		- File where all requests are logged.
#	client_certificates [CA] [optional CRL]
#		- Require client certificates to be sent for the given
#		  CA with an optional CRL file.
#
# Handlers
#
# Handlers are either static (for fixed paths) or dynamic.
# Dynamic handlers take a POSIX regular expression as its path.
#
# Syntax:
#	handler		path		module_callback		[auth block]
#
# Note that the auth block is optional and if set will force Kore to
# authenticate the user according to the authentication block its settings
# before allowing access to the page.

# Example domain that responds to localhost.
