Kore TODO list
===============

- Websocket support.
- Better param syntax
- Auxiliary library framework.
	- Provide more API functions for generic stuff such as
	  session handler, page building, etc etc.
- API to programmatically configure, start and stop Kore.
- Find that one memory leak that's causing me agony beyond belief.
- Get my hands on a 48 core server to test stuff on.
