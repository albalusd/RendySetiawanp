Kore TODO list
===============

- Websocket support.
- GET arguments (only POST supported).
- POST multiform/form-data support.
- GOAWAY for SPDY connections that have been idle too long.
- Auxiliary library framework.
	- Provide more API functions for generic stuff such as
	  session handler, page building, etc etc.
- Ability to load one module per domain instead of one global module.
- API to programmatically configure, start and stop Kore.
- Find that one memory leak that's causing me agony beyond belief.
- Get my hands on a 48 core server to test stuff on.

Ideas
=====
- If a page handler keeps causing issues, show a generic error page?
