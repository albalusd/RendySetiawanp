Hi.

Kore is a SPDY based web server that handles dynamic content via loadable
modules. Inside the examples/ directory you will find a complete example
on how such modules are built (and some tools to help you get started).

Kore does support normal HTTP over SSL as well (for the less technological
advanced browsers).

Take a look at example.conf as well for an overview of the way a site
is configured and setup.

Right now Kore development is a moving process, so expect bugs.
If you run into said bugs please contact me at joris@coders.se.

To get started put some X.509 certificates in a folder called certs
and run a make to get everything compiled. If if doesn't compile out of
the box there's something you can help me out with.

I should add a TODO list.
