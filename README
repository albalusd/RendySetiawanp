Hi.

Kore is a fast webserver that facilitates creating dynamic websites in
the C programming language. It takes away the bottleneck of constantly
loading items from disk or executing non compiled code (PHP, Perl, ...).

With a site loaded as a module in memory the page callbacks are directly called from the worker proceses and requests can be handled incredibly fast.

No overhead.

Features
- Supports SPDY/3
- Supports HTTP/1.1
- Secure by default
- SSL connections only
- Virtual host support
- Easy to use configuration
- Loads your site as a precompiled C module
- Event driven architecture and worker processes for throughput
- Modules can be reloaded on-the-fly even while serving content

Current supported systems:
- Linux
- OpenBSD

Any other BSD might function, but is untested.

Right now Kore development is a moving process, so expect bugs.
If you run into said bugs please contact me at patches@coders.se.
