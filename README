Hi.

Kore is a fast webserver that facilitates creating dynamic websites in the
C programming language. It takes away the bottleneck of constantly loading
items from disk or executing non compiled code (PHP, Perl, ...).

Kore provides you with a set of API functions you can use to build your site
which is then loaded into the webserver as a loadable C module. Because of
this pages are mapped to functions that are directly called from the worker
processes allowing for the potential of great speed. 

As little overhead as possible.

Features
- Supports SNI
- Supports SPDY/3
- Supports HTTP/1.1
- Secure by default
- SSL connections only
- Virtual host support
- Easy to use configuration
- Loads your site as a precompiled C module
- Event driven architecture and worker processes for throughput
- Modules can be reloaded on-the-fly even while serving content

License
- Kore is licensed under the ISC license.

Platforms support
- Linux
- OpenBSD
- FreeBSD
- OSX

Right now Kore development is a moving process, so expect bugs.
