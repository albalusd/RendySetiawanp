Hi.

Kore is a SPDY based web server that handles dynamic content via loadable
modules. Inside the examples/ directory you will find a complete example
on how such modules are built (and some tools to help you get started).

Take a look at example.conf as well for an overview of the way a site
is configured and setup.

Right now Kore development is a moving process, so expect bugs.
If you run into said bugs, please contact me at joris@coders.se.

I should add a TODO list.
