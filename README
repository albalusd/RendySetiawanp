Hi.

Kore is a fast webserver that facilitates creating dynamic websites in
the C programming language. It takes away the bottleneck of constantly
loading items from disk or executing non compiled code (PHP, Perl, ...).

With a site loaded as a module in memory the page callbacks are directly called from the worker proceses and requests can be handled incredibly fast.

No overhead.

Features
	Supports SPDY/3
	Supports HTTP/1.1
	Secure by default
	SSL connections only
	Virtual host support
	Easy to use configuration
	Loads your site as a precompiled C module
	Linux epoll(7) and worker processes for throughput
	Modules can be reloaded on-the-fly even while serving content

Right now Kore development is a moving process, so expect bugs.
If you run into said bugs please contact me at patches@coders.se.
