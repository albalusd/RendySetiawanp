Hi.

Kore is a SPDY based web server that handles dynamic content via loadable
modules. Inside the examples/ directory you will find a complete example
on how such modules are built (and some tools to help you get started).

Kore does support normal HTTP over SSL as well.
(for the less technological advanced browsers).

Take a look at example.conf as well for an overview of the way a site
is configured and setup.

Right now Kore development is a moving process, so expect bugs.
If you run into said bugs please contact me at joris@coders.se.

To get started put some X.509 certificates in a folder called certs
and run a make to get everything compiled. If if doesn't compile out of
the box there's something you can help me out with.

You can tell kore to reload its site module by sending a SIGHUP signal
to the main process. Sending a SIGQUIT signal will reap all worker
processes and shutdown the server.

I should add a TODO list.

Page to function mapping
========================
In the configuration file you specify how pages on your site are
mapped to what callback in your module.

static /profile.html serve_profile

The above example binds the callback serve_profile() to the profile.html page.
Kore automatically calls this callback when the page is requested by a client.

All callbacks must be based on this prototype:
	int callback(struct http_request *);

Callback functions MUST return either KORE_RESULT_OK,
KORE_RESULT_ERROR or KORE_RESULT_RETRY.

KORE_RESULT_OK will cleanup the request and remove it.
KORE_RESULT_ERROR will disconnect the client immediately after returning.
KORE_RESULT_RETRY will reschedule the callback to be called again.

Most of the times KORE_RESULT_ERROR or KORE_RESULT_OK should come from:
	int http_response(struct http_request *req,
	    int status, u_int8_t *data, u_int32_t datalen);

The http_response() function is used to queue up the HTTP response
(including status code and content to be sent).

If you wish to add headers to the response do so before calling http_response():
	void http_response_header_add(struct http_request *req,
	    char *header, char *value);

If your callback wants to use POST data, it should populate it first by calling:
	int http_populate_arguments(struct http_request *req);

The returned value is the number of arguments available.
After calling the populate function you can retrieve arguments by calling:
	int http_argument_lookup(struct http_request *req,
	    const char *name, char **out);

This will store the value of the requested argument in the out parameter.
If http_argument_lookup() returns KORE_RESULT_ERROR out will be NULL.

Please see the example/ folder for a good overview of a module.

Static content
==============
Static content is included directly in the module.
The example module shows how this is done.

After adding each static component to the Makefile, it will convert it
to a .c source file and export certain symbols that can be used by the module.

Each component gets 3 symbols:
	static_[html|css]_<component_name>		actual data.
	static_len_[html|css]_<component_name>		length of the data.
	static_mtime_[html|css]_<component_name>	last modified timestamp.

API functions
=============
	See includes/kore.h and includes/http.h for a definite overview.
