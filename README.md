About
-----
Kore (https://kore.io) is an easy to use web application framework for
writing scalable web APIs in C. Its main goals are security, scalability
and allowing rapid development and deployment of such APIs.

Because of this Kore is an ideal candidate for building robust, scalable and secure web things.

I apologize for unclear examples or documentation, I am working on
improving those.
